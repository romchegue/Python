AS NOTED IN CREATING REUSABLE PLAYBOOKS, INCLUDE AND IMPORT STATEMENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR, HOWEVER THE ANSIBLE EXECUTOR ENGINE TREATS THEM VERY DIFFERENTLY.

ALL IMPORT* STATEMENTS ARE PRE-PROCESSED AT THE TIME PLAYBOOKS ARE PARSED.
ALL INCLUDE* STATEMENTS ARE PROCESSED AS THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED DURING THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAYBOOK.
PLEASE REFER TO CREATING REUSABLE PLAYBOOKS FOR DOCUMENTATION CONCERNING THE TRADE-OFFS ONE MAY ENCOUNTER WHEN USING EACH TYPE.
END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
