A Christmas Carol (1843) is a novella 
by Charles Dickens, illustrated by John Leech. 
It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser
 who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob M
 arley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After
 their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man. Dicken
 s wrote the story during a period when the British were exploring and re-ev
 aluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer cu
 stoms such as Christmas trees. His Christmas stories (i
 ncluding three before and four after this one) we
 re influenced by those of other authors, including Washing
 ton Irving and Douglas William Jerrold. Parts of the novella po
 int out the misery that poor children often endured; Dickens had re
 cently witnessed appalling conditions for children working in the Corn
 ish tin mines. He gave 128 public readings of A Christmas Carol, includin
 g his farewell perfor
 mance in 1870, the year of his death. (Full article...)
